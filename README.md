This is my first experience with the Spring Framework. Using Amazon Web Services, I created a table of students, which
contains a unique id, their name, and the the course (major) they are studying. I followed the MVC pattern to allow for
searching by id, name, and course and to update the database with the usual removing, adding, changing values.
